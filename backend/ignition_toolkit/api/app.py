# No external dependencies - uses token bucket algorithm
app.add_middleware(RateLimitMiddleware)

# SECURITY: loopback callers (the desktop app) pass through untouched; anything
# arriving over a network interface must present a valid X-API-Key. See
# RemoteAccessAuthMiddleware's docstring for why enforcement is drawn here
# rather than as a dependency on all 24 routers — the frontend has no way to
# send a credential, so that would lock the user out of their own app.
app.add_middleware(RemoteAccessAuthMiddleware)

# CORS middleware.
#
# This used to be allow_origins=["*"] with allow_credentials=True. That
# combination is worse than it looks: Starlette cannot send a literal "*" with
# credentials, so it echoes the caller's Origin header back instead — which
# means EVERY origin is allowed, with credentials. Any web page the user
# happened to be visiting could drive this API, and this API manages the
# credential vault and runs playbooks.
#
# The old comment justified the wildcard with "backend only binds to
# 127.0.0.1". Binding to loopback does not help here: the attacker's code runs
# in the user's own browser, which reaches loopback perfectly well.
#
# run_backend.py already computes the correct allowlist and exports it as
# ALLOWED_ORIGINS; that value was previously never read by anything. It is read
# here now. The fallback covers the dev servers and is still origin-specific.
